Input is read from STDIN and output produced to STDOUT.

The following fields names are supported.
host,ip,q,r,date,type,url,httpversion,status,length,ref,ua


e.g

To get a count by ip "cat log | ./weblogs.pl ip"

To get a count by ip where no referer was set "cat log | ./weblogs.pl ref=^-$ ip"

To get a count by ip where a referer was set "cat log | ./weblogs.pl ref-^-$ ip"

To filter out my own ip 1.1.1.1 and firefox and then count by http version and status. "cat log | ./weblogs.pl ip-1\.1\.1\.1 ua-firefox httpversion status"

To view the raw log for all 404 "cat log | ./weblogs.pl status=404"
